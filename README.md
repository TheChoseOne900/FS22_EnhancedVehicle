# FS22_EnhancedVehicle
This is a Mod for Farming Simulator 22. It adds a basic "snap driving direction" mode, differential locks, wheel drive modes and improved hydraulics controls to your vehicle. It also shows more vehicle details on the HUD.

**ATTENTION: Key bindings changed during development. If you can't access a mod function: check your key bindings and rebind the function.**

**WARNING: Work-in-progress. This is a dev version - it might contain bugs. Please report unusual issues.**

**NOTE: The only source of truth is: https://github.com/ZhooL/FS22_EnhancedVehicle. The second valid download location is: (still to be defined). All other download locations are not validated by me - so handle with care.**

**NOTE2: I implemented the "basic snap direction feature" only because no proper GPS/GuidanceSteering is released yet. Feature may be removed if other mods provide this functionality in a better way.**

## Known bugs
* No bug, but I'm not 100% satisfied with the grid visualization for asymmetric attachments like plows...

## What this mod does
* When the game starts, it changes all "motorized" and "controllable" vehicles on the map to default settings: wheel drive mode to "all-wheel (4WD)" and deactivation of both differentials.
* Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Numpad /</kbd> to open the config dialog.
* Press <kbd>R Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>End</kbd> to keep your vehicle driving in the current direction.
  * Press <kbd>R Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Home</kbd> to reverse snap direction (useful after turn around at end of field)
* Press <kbd>R Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Numpad 1</kbd> to enable the lane assistant
  * If you now enable snap mode the vehicle will drive on the current marked lane
* On HUD it displays:
  * Damage values in % for controlled vehicle and all its attachments.
  * Fuel fill level for Diesel/AdBlue/Electric/Methane and the current fuel usage rate<sup>1</sup>.
  * The current status of the differential locks and wheel drive mode.
  * The current engine RPM and temperature<sup>1</sup>.
  * The current mass of the vehicle and the total mass of vehicle and all its attachments and loads.
* Keybindings can be changed in the game options menu.

**<sup>1</sup> In multiplayer games, all clients, except the host, won't display the fuel usage rate and engine temperature correctly due to GIANTS Engine fail**

## What this mod doesn't (fully) do
* Work on consoles. Buy a PC for proper gaming.
