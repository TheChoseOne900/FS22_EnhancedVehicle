# FS22_EnhancedVehicle
This is a Mod for Farming Simulator 22. It adds a track assistant ("GPS light") and a "snap driving direction" feature, differential locks, wheel drive modes and improved hydraulics controls to your vehicle. It also shows more vehicle details on the HUD.

**ATTENTION: Key bindings changed during development. If you can't access a mod function: check your key bindings and rebind the function.**

  * Configure headland behavior in configuration menu
* On HUD it displays:
  * (When snap/track is enabled) The current snap to angle and current track and turnover number(
  * Damage values in % for controlled vehicle and all its attachments.
  * Fuel fill level for Diesel/AdBlue/Electric/Methane and the current fuel usage rate<sup>1</sup>.
